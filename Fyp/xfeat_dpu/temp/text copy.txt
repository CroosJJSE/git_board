XFextractorDPU.h should be a child class of XfeatSLAMExtractor.h
have to implement all virtual functions in the XfeatSLAMExtractor.h to the XFextractorDPU.h
dont touch the public function becasue it is used in other parts of the XfeatSLAMExtractor
we have to implement in OOPs (inheretance)
for example as follow
XFextractorBase *obj = new XFextractorDPU();
obj->getInputWidth(); // there will be an error if it is not in parent class
